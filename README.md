Artificial Intelligence 
Project 2 - Naive Bayesian classisfier
This is the README.md file that will be used to explain my second submission of project 2. 
I did this in python with Scikit learn. I have resolved all the issues I was having in the 
first release of this project. I have included the .csv file (bill_authentication.csv) that
I had used for testing. In menu item 3, the user is prompted to input each feature with a value.
The values for each feature are pushed to a list, which is then turned to an array with numpy. 
It predicts the outcome and that value is converted into a textual output that tells you
likely or not likely. Menu item 4 works as it should, and just uses the same functions as menu
item 3, with the added functionality of being able to load previously saved classifier models. 
Please contact me if there are any ambiguities in my code, and I will try my best to reply
as soon as possible. 

Thank you !
